#Password Manager in C#
This a a password management system
Written in C# and implemented using .Net Framework

#Instructions
The password manager must be able to handle different users and store their
usernames and passwords for websites, desktop applications & games.
• If storing a username & password for a website it should store the username,
the password, the website name, the website URL, date created, date last
updated
• If storing the username & password for a desktop application, it should store
the username, the password, the application name, date created, date last
updated
• If storing the username & password for a game, it should store the username,
the password, the game name, the game developer, date created & date last
updated
The user should be able to add, edit & delete passwords stored in the application.
The user should be able to view the login’s currently stored, however the password
should be hidden, but the user can choose to show the password in plain text.
All passwords should be encrypted and stored in a database or text file. You are
required to design the encryption algorithm. The application should also be able to
decrypt the encrypted password to show the original in plain text. A state diagram will
be required for your encrypt and decrypt algorithm.
The users should be able to search for passwords by the name of the website/
application/ game.
The user should be able to sort the passwords by the last updated date.
When adding a new password, the application should provide an option to generate a
random password. You are required to design the algorithm that generates a random
password.
Users should be able to login with a username and password, and they should only
be able to see the passwords that they have created. There will be an admin login,
that will be able to see all passwords for all users and be able to edit & delete them.
